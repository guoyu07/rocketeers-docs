# Creating tasks

Now that we've informed Rocketeer on how our application and server are structured, it's time to tell it what to do to deploy it. Now, by default it's pretty smart and will know how to install your dependencies and stuff, but that's not all is it?

Let's review how to do various common things to prepare a release for use in production.

## Overriding subtasks: database operations

Most common task you can create: database stuff. When Deploy fires, within it it fires _another task_ (tasks can be nested at will like that). That task is called `Migrate`... but by default it does nothing (since migrations are usually framework-specific), so just like we did for `Primer`, we can override it in `hooks.php`.

Imagine we're running a Laravel application, we would need to call `php artisan migrate --force`, and maybe we have a backup command to call beforehand, so let's write our task as such:

**.rocketeer/config/hooks.php**

```php
<?php
'tasks' => [
    'Migrate' => function () {
        $this->runForApplication([
            'php artisan db:backup',
            'php artisan migrate --force',
        ]);
    },
],
```

As I mentioned before, by default `run` runs command in the configured `root_directory`. In local that's the current directory so that's fine but on the server the root directory is the root of the Rocketeer folder (eg. `/home/www/website`), but that's not where we want to run commands, we want to run them in whatever the current release is (eg. `/home/www/websites/releases/123456789`), so for this we use `runForApplication`.

As you can see here we are not returning the results of `run...`, because then Rocketeer would use whatever those commands output to judge whether the task succeeded, but our migration command could have output and still have failed, which would be dangerous.

This is a **very important** concept in Rocketeer: if you return something, whatever it is (array, string, boolean), if it evaluates to truethy the task will be considered a success. So in this case we don't return anything, and in that case Rocketeer will use the exit status of the last command (`artisan migrate && artisan db:backup`) instead.

This means if any of those two task failed and returned an erroneous exit status, our Migrate task would be considered a failure, which is perfect (I mean kinda)!

## Your first real task: clearing caches and compiling stuff

Ok that was relatively easy, we just overwrote a core task like we did for Primer and filled-in whatever logic we needed. But most of the time we need to do more than migrate things for a deployment, where do we do the rest?

This is where events come in. Rocketeer leverages **events** for its tasks, built on top of [league/event](http://event.thephpleague.com). What that means is that, whenever a task fires, it fires a `before` event, and an `after` event we can hook into. Some fire more than that but those two are at least _guaranteed_ to always be there.

If you go back to `hooks.php` you may have noticed we actually have an `events` array pre-created for us, let's see how to use it. We want to per example, clear Laravel's cache after a deployment, so we want to hook `after.deploy` and run `php artisan cache:clear`. Which means our task is going to go here:

**.rocketeer/config/hooks.php**

```php
<?php
return [
  'hooks' => [

    'events' => [
      'after' => [
        'deploy' => [
          // Here!
        ],
      ],
    ],

  ],
];
```

Now as I mentioned in the previous section, a task can be three things: a string/array of strings, a closure, or a class. Let's try to write our task in the three styles to give you an idea.

### Writing a string task

This is the easiest of them all, cause it's just a string:

```php
'after' => [
  'deploy' => [
    'php artisan cache:clear',
  ],
],
```

Done, that was easy; an array of tasks works exactly the same way:

```php
'after' => [
  'deploy' => [
    ['php artisan cache:clear'],
  ],
],
```

### Writing a closure task

Same as before with Primer and Migrate, we write a Closure and use one of the `run` methods (in this case `runForApplication`):

```php
'after' => [
  'deploy' => [
    function () {
      $this->runForApplication('php artisan cache:clear');
    }
  ],
],
```

Notice how we don't return the output of the command here either, we want to trust the exist status instead. Note that you can do this manually too:

```php
'after' => [
  'deploy' => [
    function () {
      $this->runForApplication('php artisan cache:clear');

      return $this->status();
    }
  ],
],
```

The `status` method returns a boolean, `true` if the exit status was 0, `false` otherwise. But what if you want to do something when it fails? Or display a custom error message? Well in those cases, you can use the `halt($message)` method, which will manually fail the task and display a more context-specific error message:

```php
'after' => [
  'deploy' => [
    function () {
      $this->runForApplication('php artisan cache:clear');

      return $this->status() || $this->halt('Failed to clear the cache');
    }
  ],
],
```

### Writing a class task

Now let's dive into the belly of the beast, let's write a task class. If you look into your `.rocketeer` folder, you should see a `tasks.php` file created at the root, this is just a standard file loaded by Rocketeer on boot, you can put anything you want in there. Same goes for `events.php`.

In order to write a task class, you need to write a class that extends `Rocketeer\Tasks\AbstractTask`. The core logic of the task will go into the `execute` method â€“ if you've provided your IDE with autocompletions it should already suggest you to implement it. So let's do so:

**.rocketeer/tasks.php**

```php
<?php
class ClearCache extends Rocketeer\Tasks\AbstractTask
{
    public function execute()
    {
        $this->runForApplication('php artisan cache:clear');

        return $this->status() || $this->halt('Failed to clear the cache');
    }
}
```

Now, to register that task, we could very well use its qualified name in our `hooks.php` file like this:

```php
'after' => [
  'deploy' => [ClearCache::class],
],
```

But we can also use the `Rocketeer` class to do this. Head over to `events.php`, and let's rewrite our event there:

**.rocketeer/events.php**

```php
Rocketeer::after('deploy', ClearCache::class);
```

Underneath, the Rocketeer proxies the `TasksHandler` class, there are a bunch of those methods available (like `before`), you can check out the API section of the documentation for more information.
